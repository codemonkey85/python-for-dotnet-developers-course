# Python for the .NET Developer course

[![](readme_resources/python-for-dotnet-course.png)](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/python-for-csharp-dotnet-developers)

Are you a .NET developer who is interested in learning Python? **This is \*the\* course for you**. While there are many getting started courses for Python, this course is specifically geared towards helping C# and .NET developers quickly get up to speed with Python. It covers a wide spectrum of the developer landscape from the language, databases and ORMs, web frameworks, data science and computational notebooks, and much much more.

## What's this course about and how is it different?

This is the definitive course to learn the entire Python ecosystem for .NET developers. We spend over 9 hours comparing Python and C#, the Python runtime and the .NET CLR, NuGet to PyPI, and much more. **You will see working C# examples _first_**. Then we will build the Python equivalent of that application live, together, during the course.

In this course, you will:

- See how Python and .NET are similar and how they are different
- Get setup and ready to write and run Python 3 on your computer
- Dive deep into the Python language while comparing each element to it's C# equivalent
- Work with classes, inheritance, method overriding and more in Python
- Leverage the over 200,000 public packages (libraries) using pip and related tooling
- Explore Python's two memory management models and how they differ from .NET's GC
- Choose a Python web framework comparable to ASP.NET MVC
- Build data driven web applications using Flask and the ORM SQLAlchemy
- Test your Python libraries and application with pytest
- Mock out your dependencies for true unit testing with pytest_mock
- Leverage async and await (in Python!) for massively parallel processing
- Explore and visualize data with computational notebooks using JupyterLab
- Deploy a Flask (Python) web app on a Linux cloud VM using nginx and uWSGI
- Secure your web app on Linux with Let's Encrypt to add free SSL support
- And lots more

## Who is this course for?

With this course, the name really does say it all. If you know C# and .NET and would like to leverage that expertise in the Python space, this course is for you.

The course *does not assume Python knowledge*. But it does assume you know basic C# code and that you wish the leverage that knowledge to learn Python faster and deeper.
